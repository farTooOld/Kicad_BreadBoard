# Kicad_BreadBoard

A Video Demonstration of Kicad's ability/compatibility with BreadBoard (BB) is posted at YouTube. https://youtu.be/j06vDN3KJtE
The Demo shows several aspects of this, including NGSpice Simulation of a BreadBoard's Circuit (also shows the equivalent Standard Circuit' simulation for comparison). 


BreadBoard and Jumper-Wires for Use In Kicad
Kicad uses Footprints in the PCB layout.
Footprints can be linked to 3D-Models (STEP and/or WRL(graphic).
Footprints can be linked to Schematic 'Symbols'.

Schematic's are NOT absolutely required for a BreadBoard (or, PCB) and simple Hand-Sketched hobby circuits are an ideal use-case for this.
Naturally, it's always preferred to have a Schematic (for various reasons).

User's will need to consider and ERC/DRC aspects (including settings, ignore, warnings, errors...etc) and make appropriate settings as needed.

(I ignore all ERC/DRC and I generally don't use the Tool)

Note: Although User's can have both PCB-circuit and BB-circuit in the same Schematic, consideration to duplication of Netlist items may cause difficulty... (the example Circuit's in Video work fine if both are in Schematic but I chose to delete one or the other for Video).

If User chooses, the 3D-Viewer has File>Export of the Graphic

Lastly, this Video is NOT a Tutorial on Simulation or, on Kicad usage...

PARTS: Jumper-Wires, BreadBoards (Mini and 81x53) FOOTPRINT's and SYMBOL's are posted Here at Github. Also posted is the Jumper-Wire (FreeCAD for those desirous of Tweaking and/or Creating new Jumpers)

BB dimensions vary depending brand/source these are based on my hardware and are within a few Millimeters of one-another.
Wires/Jumpers are dimensionally close-enough for use but are not Exact - Many represent an Average that will enable use for Straight and Angled orientation with only Minor notice...(I hope!)

FOOTPRINT's and SYMBOL's

I generally don't fuss about Detailing out various aspects of Footprints such as Silk, Courtyard...etc.
